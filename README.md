# SimpleEncryption
To run the program: 
The executable should be in the top most folder where this readme is found, named SimpleEncryption.exe.
All required dependencies are also in this folder, so application should run and work. Instructions for use within app.

Program Summary:
Created for educational purposes, this simple console application will encrypt or decrypt a line of text given. 

Warnings:
This program is very limited and the encryptions and decryptions used are very simple and probably very easy to crack.
Therefore, this program should only be used for educational purposes, but has an MIT License if anyone wants to build 
off of it, just know -- you have been warned: it's not very good.

Ethical and Responsible Use:
To emphasize again, this tool does indeed encrypt text, however the encryption is very weak, and thus can be misused in 
giving the user a false sense of security in the encryption.
